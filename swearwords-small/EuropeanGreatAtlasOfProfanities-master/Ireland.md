# Ireland

Well we all speak English so swearing at someone in Irish is pointless because maybe one or two will understand but the rest won’t, if you want a good old fashioned swear word we say though, you can’t go wrong with Gobshite


- Ceann do mháthair: your moms vagina
- As Luimneach: somebody will never achieve anything
- Cac: shite
- Amadan/gombean: fool
- Póg mo thóin : kiss my arse
- Godnakende gloeiende hoerenzoon :  godforsaken son of a whore
