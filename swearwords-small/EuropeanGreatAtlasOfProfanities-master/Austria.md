# Austria 

In general, Austrian insults are usually intended to make you laugh as well as insult you.

We often use mental images that compare people to stupid things, to joke about them.

"Pudl di ned auf Hustinettenbär" for example is a common phrase when people get angry, telling them that they should stop taking themselves too serious and that they come off like a clown.

Literally, "aufpudln" is used for "dressing well", wearing your finest clothes. It's referring to poodles, who traditionally get styled by their owners to look fancy, as well as the "Hustinettenbär", an advertisment-figure for cough-medicine.

"Hau die über'd Heisa" or "Throw yourself over the houses" is a viennese way to tell people that they should leave, right now and as fast as they can, because they are not welcome. Sometimes "Schleich dich" is used, meaning "Sneak yourself", implying that you do not want to hear anything from the other person, not even them walking away. Both ways to tell the other person that you're not interested in interacting with them anymore because you do not value them.

But of course, we also got the common fecal language, like "geh scheißen" ("go, have a shit"), "Arschloch" ("Asshole"), "Dir hams ins Hirn gschissn" ("someone has taken a shit in your brain"), etc.

In general, the more "fun" there is in the insult, the less serious it is. Some of them can also be used in non-insulting ways, like "Schleicht dich", which is occasionally used when someone tells you something incredible. In this case, it's used as "I don't believe you. You must be lying to me. Stop that. Be serious now". It's usually said in a tone of disbelief if used in this way and in a more demanding tone when used as an insult.
