## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Read in the cleaned data from a CSV file
data <- read.csv("data/cleaned_data.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# Apply the politeness package to the data
data <- politeness(data)
data
```

```{r}
# Features to use as a metric are 'Apology', 'bare command', 'gratitude', 'informal title', 'please', 'swearing'
df_politeness_count <- politeness(data$post, metric="count")
```


```{r}
write.csv(df_politeness_count, 'data/politeness_features.csv')
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
